## Setting up nginx-unit and https on a raspberry pi

I started with just about a fresh install of Raspberry Pi OS (Debian 10).

The scripts are pretty simple and have some explanations at the top. They
can be used directly, but I'd recommend looking over them more as a guide to get
a general idea of the steps involved. They should be done in alphabetical order:

1. [install-dependencies](install-dependencies)
2. [install-unit](install-unit)
3. [setup-certbot](setup-certbot)
4. [setup-example](setup-example)
5. [setup-service](setup-service)
