## Setting up nginx-unit and https on a raspberry pi

I started with just about a fresh install of Raspberry Pi OS (Debian 10).

The scripts are pretty simple and have some explanations at the top. They
can be used directly, or as a guide to get a general idea of the steps
involved. They should be run in alphabetical order:

1. `./install-dependencies`
2. `./install-unit`
3. `./setup-certbot`
4. `./setup-example`
